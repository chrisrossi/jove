Services

Sometimes you want some functionality to be available across all sites.
For example, you might want admin users that can support all your
customers. Sometimes you have a persistent facility which needs to be
local to a site, but always available.

Jove has a concept called *service* which provides this. A service can
be global or local.

Services are still an evolving idea. For now, the local
service ``jove_catalog`` is the only implemented service.
